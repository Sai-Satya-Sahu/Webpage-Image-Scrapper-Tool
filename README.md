# üéâ Welcome to My First Project

## üåê Webpage Image Scraper + üìÑ PDF Converter

Welcome to my very first GitHub project!  
This tool is designed to **scrape all important document images from a webpage** ‚Äî like scanned book pages or online document viewers ‚Äî and **convert them into a PDF** automatically.

I hope you like my project and find it helpful! ‚ù§Ô∏è

### ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ **Smart Document Image Detection**  
  Automatically skips logos, ads, buttons, and other non-document images.

- üìú **Deep Scroll & Lazy Load Support**  
  Scrolls the page fully and waits to load even lazy-loaded images.

- üîÅ **Auto Retry on Timeout or Connection Issues**  
  Built-in retry mechanism ensures reliable downloads even on slow networks.

- üìÇ **Organized Output**  
  Downloads go into a folder named `downloaded_images/`.

- üß† **PDF Generator Tool**  
  Automatically combines the downloaded images into a clean, page-by-page PDF.

### üß† How Filtering Works

Only **important images** (like scanned pages or document content) are downloaded.  
We filter out common junk like:

- `logo`, `icon`, `ad`, `banner`, `favicon`, `share`, etc.
- Images smaller than `300x300` pixels

> ‚öôÔ∏è **Want everything?**  
Just **remove or comment out** the `is_document_image()` function to disable filtering.
